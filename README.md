# Sbrite Programming Language

**Sbrite** is an experimental programming language idea aiming to minimise language features in favour of reusing similar concepts.

Check out the [Basics](docs/Basics.md) to get started or jump straight into the [Examples](docs/Examples.md) to see how some concepts can be used together.

## Parser

There's a [parser](src/Sbrite/) in progress being built with C# and [Sprache](https://github.com/sprache/Sprache). Maybe this can evolve into a proper interpretor or compiler.
